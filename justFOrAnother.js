Hi Zoran,

my name is ZACK

I noticed that it's been about three weeks since you signed up with Logojoy, but that you still hadn't downloaded your favorite logo.

As such, I thought our prices may have been too expensive for your budget?

If so, I'd like to offer you a 50% discount on our premium package.

To claim your offer, simply:

---

1. Login: to your account by clicking this link.

2. Choose your favorite logo: by clicking on it and pressing "buy".

3. Discount applied: you'll see your 50% discount on the checkout page.

I hope this helps?

Best,


Felicia Cusi
Head of Customer Success
